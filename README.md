# Medical Image Analysis Assignments

####  Assignments done for the Medical Image Analysis [course](https://online.tugraz.at/tug_online/wbLv.wbShowLVDetail?pStpSpNr=255655&pSpracheNr=2) in the summer semester 2021 at Graz University of Technology. For every assignments a report describing the theory of the algorithms used and the results obtained from the Python code was written. 

- Computed tomography reconstruction, implementation and analysis of back-projection, filtered back-projection and projection slice theorem with interpolation. See [report](https://github.com/FraCorti/Medical-Image-Analysis-Assignments/blob/master/assignments/assignment-1/report_Corti_Mazzella.pdf).

- Image denoising, implementation and analysis of four denoising methods: Tikhonov, Perona-Malik, Total Variation ROF and Primal-Dual ROF See [report](https://github.com/FraCorti/Medical-Image-Analysis-Assignments/blob/master/assignments/assignment-2/report_Corti_Mazzella.pdf).

- Image registration methods, implementation and analysis of Procrustes and Iterative Closest Point algorithms. See [report](https://github.com/FraCorti/Medical-Image-Analysis-Assignments/blob/master/assignments/assignment-3/report_Corti_Mazzella.pdf).

- Segmentation method, implementation and analysis of the Active Shape Model segmentation algorithm. See [report](https://github.com/FraCorti/Medical-Image-Analysis-Assignments/blob/master/assignments/assignment-4/report_Corti_Mazzella.pdf).
